# üöó PID Line Follower Robot (Arduino)

This Arduino project is a **PID-controlled Line Follower Robot** that uses three IR sensors to follow a black line on a white surface. The robot uses a basic PID control algorithm to adjust its motor speeds in real-time for smooth and accurate line tracking.

# üß† How Each Component Works

- **Arduino Uno:** Acts as the brain, reads IR sensor values, calculates PID, and adjusts motor speeds.

- **L298N Motor Driver:** Bridges low-power Arduino and high-current motors, enabling direction and speed control.

- **Li-Po Battery:** Supplies sufficient current for motors and Arduino. Choose 7.4V or 11.1V depending on your motor rating.

- **Buck Converter:** Converts higher battery voltage to safe 5V/9V for Arduino (if not powering via USB).

- **BO Motors + Wheels:** Convert electrical energy into motion. Used for left and right drive.

- **Caster Wheel:** Provides a third balancing point, allows smooth turning.

- **Chassis:** Holds everything together and makes the robot rigid and movable.

- **Breadboard:** For testing connections before finalizing them.

- **PCB:** Permanent version of the circuit for reliability and compactness.

- **IR Sensors:** Detect black/white contrast. Give analog or digital output depending on configuration.

- **Jumper Wires:** Connect everything without needing to solder.

# ‚öôÔ∏è PID Constants

```cpp
float kp = 120;
float ki = 0.0;
float kd = 70;
```

### PID Constants Explanation

- **kp** ‚Äì Proportional constant. Affects how aggressively the robot reacts to errors.  
- **ki** ‚Äì Integral constant. Helps eliminate accumulated small errors (often kept 0 for line following).  
- **kd** ‚Äì Derivative constant. Reacts to rate of error change. Helps prevent oscillations.  

>* Note - I gave 9V power supply to battery, if you are using 12V battery then use lower value of kp and kd like (kp=70 and kd=40)

_Tune these values based on your robot‚Äôs turning behavior._

### üìä How It Works

- IR sensors continuously read surface reflectivity.  
- A PID controller calculates the position error based on sensor readings.  
- Based on PID output, the motor speeds are adjusted:  
  - If the robot is veering left, speed of right motor is increased (or left decreased).  
  - If it's veering right, speed of left motor is increased.  
- This lets the robot follow the path accurately and smoothly.

### üíª Code Upload Instructions

1. Connect your Arduino Uno to your PC via USB cable.  
2. Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.  
3. Go to **Tools > Board > Arduino Uno**.  
4. Go to **Tools > Port** and select the correct COM port.  
5. Click **Upload** (the ‚û°Ô∏è arrow icon in the IDE).  
6. (Optional) Open the Serial Monitor to see debug values from IR sensors.
